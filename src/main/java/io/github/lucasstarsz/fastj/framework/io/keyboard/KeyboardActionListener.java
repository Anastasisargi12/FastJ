/**
 * A keyboard action listener.
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b> For use with a FastJ {@code Scene}, a keyboard action listener must be added to a
 * {@code Scene}'s list of keyboard action listeners.
 * <br>
 * If you are planning to implement this class into a separate usage, you may consider using the {@code InputManager}
 * class to store a list of keyboard action listeners. Then, have events from a class extending {@code KeyListener}
 * fired to that {@code InputManager}.
